As a product owner in an Agile environment, your role is to help your team “build the right thing” as efficiently as possible by setting the vision and priorities. Harness each of these 7 habits to maximize the effectiveness of your team and your performance as a product owner.

## Take Accountability
As the keeper of your team’s vision and roadmap, it’s on you to take accountability for the decisions you ask your team to engage in. Always assume accountability for what you ask the team to do; they will respect your ability to not “pass the buck.”

## Make the Team Your #1 Priority
Your team meetings take precedence over everything else. For you to be effective as a product owner and for your team to be effective a whole, you need to be present at all team ceremonies.

Make it easier on everyone by scheduling out all foundational events as far out as possible with your Scrum Master. That way, when other meeting requests pop up, you can point to the filled time block on your calendar. By consistently showing up for your team, they’ll be more likely to return the favor and show up for the product/project at hand.

 ## Own Your Stories
You and your team must be on the same page when it comes to stories: what’s to be accomplished and what “ready” means. Reserve time to make sure everyone has a shared understanding, so you meet quality objectives and stay on track. Make sure you include detailed descriptions and acceptance criteria for stories during sprint planning.

If you don’t provide the information your team needs, you set them up to become amateur detectives, hunting for clues to figure out what you’re looking for. Instead, set aside 15 minutes each day after stand up to work through 1 or 2 stories.

 ## Establish a Culture of Trust
High-performance levels and trust go hand in hand. To establish a culture of trust, communicate with your team, share information and encourage them to do the same. As your team acquires more knowledge, you can focus on more strategic activities.

Some simple ways to develop a foundation of trust:

1. Invite the Scrum Master to stakeholder meetings
2. Share results with your team
3. Ask your team to share their opinion and implement their feedback

## Learn to Say No
Product Owners must have the courage to say “no.” Yes, you want to keep your stakeholders happy but not at the expense of your team. Avoid constantly interrupting your team; it only creates inefficiencies and disruption.

There will certainly be times when negotiation is needed, and you should include your team in making these decisions, which will foster an environment of trust.

## Constantly Prioritize
A good product owner prioritizes often and frequently through conversations with stakeholders and team members. You should come into each planning event ready with a set of priorities to discuss with the team. When you wait until the planning session to prioritize your stories, you communicate that it’s of low priority to you and your team.

Waiting until the planning session to prioritize your stories is too late and once again communicates it is not important to you or the team. Prioritizing is another aspect of owning your stories. By setting aside a small time-box each day, you’ll keep the priorities in line with the team objectives.

## Partner with the Team
Your team is your greatest asset in delivering quality products that produce positive outcomes for your customers. Partner with the team through every stage of the process. Illustrate your willingness to change processes and dedicate time to them to strengthen the environment of trust.
