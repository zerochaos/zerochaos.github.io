Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) states that the Cloud Native strategy is about scale and resilience: “distributed systems capable of scaling to tens of thousands of self healing multi-tenant nodes”. Cloud Native is about getting new products and services to market faster. Whether a business is a startup or an Enterprise trying to evolve more quickly, they want to use a Cloud Native architecture in order to innovate more rapidly.

## The Purpose of Cloud Native
“Cloud Native” is the name of a particular approach to designing, building and running applications based on infrastructure-as-a-service combined with new operational tools and services like continuous integration, container engines and orchestrators. The overall objective is to improve speed, scalability and finally margin.

## Cloud Native Fundamentals
The fundamentals of Cloud Native have been described as container packaging, dynamic management and a Microservices-oriented architecture, which sounds like a lot of work. What does it actually mean and is it worth the effort? We believe Cloud Native promotes five architectural principles:

1. Use infrastructure-as-a-service: run on servers that can be flexibly provisioned on demand.
2. Design systems using, or evolve them towards, a microservices architecture: individual components are small and decoupled.
3. Automate and encode: replace manual tasks with scripts or code.
4. Containerize: package processes with their dependencies making them easy to test, move and deploy.
5. Orchestrate: abstract away individual servers in production using off-the-shelf management and orchestration tools.
