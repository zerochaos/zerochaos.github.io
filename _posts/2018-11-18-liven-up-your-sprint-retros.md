title: Liven Up Your Sprint Retros

“That meeting could have been an e-mail!” — a sentiment we are far too familiar with at our workplace. And it usually occurs when a meeting offers no agenda or actionable outcome.

But that doesn’t have to be the case always, does it? Take for instance, the daily scrum — a 15-minute sync-up meeting that takes place every day for the team to share updates and communicate the next course of action during a sprint. The daily scrum is essential to inspect and adapt the sprint to achieve the set goals.

And once you have completed the sprint, how do you verify its success?

Enter, sprint retrospective.

## Commence, Continue, Cease
The sprint retrospective meeting forms a vital part of the scrum process and takes place at the
end of a sprint. It focuses on improving the efficacy of future sprints by bringing the team
together to reflect and discuss the following aspects:
1. Commence – Recommend the new practices and processes that can help the team perform tasks better and faster.
2. Continue – Highlight processes that have enabled seamless execution of tasks.
3. Cease – Speak about practices that add no value to the sprint and should be discontinued.

A well-planned sprint retrospective explores new possibilities, meaningful processes, and better execution strategy that enables the team to progress towards the intended goal.

Although the above discussed aspects form the foundation of a good sprint retrospective, you need to keep the momentum going by ensuring each team member is engaged and motivated to contribute.

So, what do you do?

## Bring in Novelty
Introduce games or other productive activities that are relevant to your team or project, and requires each team member to participate. Generate interest by asking each one of them about their expectations, share your expectations, and see how you create fun, engaging conversations.

## Maintain Focus
The goal is to concentrate efforts towards making the next sprint more effective. So, stay focused on the retrospective agenda by employing kanban boards. This approach will help address problems and challenges encountered during the sprint in an organized manner.

## Ensure an Actionable Outcome
To see the desired results, make sure that each team member is assigned an actionable task. Engage in constructive conversations, understand the requirements, and furnish a list of tasks with a set deadline, which everyone can see and adhere to.

## Appreciate Team Effort
Never skip this. Always congratulate the team and thank them for the work they have put in the project. This will leave a positive impression on the team and motivate them to perform better in the next sprint.

Now, these were just a few ways in which you can ensure you run an effective sprint retrospective. Depending upon your team composition, current project stage, and performance trajectory you can improvise these meetings to keep the engagement and motivation level high.
